# Diabetes Progression Modeling

## Project Overview

This project aims to model the progression of diabetes using the Diabetes dataset available from the sklearn library. The model helps healthcare professionals understand how various factors influence diabetes progression, aiding in the design of better treatment plans and preventive measures.

## Objectives

- Load and preprocess the Diabetes dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
- Build an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict diabetes progression.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library. It contains several independent variables that can be used to predict the target variable, which represents diabetes progression.

## Key Components

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset and check for missing values.
   - Normalize the features to improve model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Analyze the distribution of features and the target variable.
   - Visualize relationships between features.

3. **Building the ANN Model**: 
   - Design a neural network architecture with at least one hidden layer.
   - Use appropriate activation functions.

4. **Training the ANN Model**: 
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model using suitable loss functions and optimizers.

5. **Evaluating the Model**: 
   - Assess model performance on testing data using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score.

6. **Improving the Model**: 
   - Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
   - Document changes made and their impact on performance.
